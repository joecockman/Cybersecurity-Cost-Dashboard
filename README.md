The purpose of this dashboard is to allow users to delve deeper into the data behind almost 1000 of Spotify's most streamed songs. The dashboard is built around a dataset downloaded from Kaggle, titled: 'Spotify Most Streamed Songs'. This file can be found above in the repository.

## I have included visuals on the following variables:

- Most Streamed Artists
- Most Streamed Songs
- Highest Energy Songs
- BPM (Beats per Minute)
- Number of Times Artist is Featured in Playlists

## I have also included filters on the page to help narrow your search. These include:

- Release Month
- Artist Name Search Bar

## I created the following calculated fields that are used in many of the visuals:

- J - Monthly Top 5 Streams
- J - Monthly Top 5 BPM
- J - Monthly Top 5 Energy
- J - Monthly Top 5 Playlists
- Name Search

## Please read on to find detailed explanations of how I put together different aspects of this dashboard:
